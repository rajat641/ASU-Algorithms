# Algorithms implementations in C/C++
The following algorithms were implemented during the time I did competitve programming and was  highly active on codeforces.
* Binary search and its variations
* Knapsack Problem
* Sorting Algorithms like Merge sort, Quick sort etc.
* Heap Data structure
  - Max heaps
  - Min heaps (priority queue)
  - Heapsort
 * Kandane's Algorithm
 * Modular exponentiation
 * Graph Algorithms
    - Topological Sorting
    - Shortest hops
    - DFS
    - BFS
    - Connected Components
    - Dijkstra's Shortest Path - O(mlogn)
    - Prim's Minimum Cost Spanning Tree - O(mlogn)
    - Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree - O(mlogn)
* Longest Increasing Subsequence
* Longest Common Subsequence
* Sieve of Eratosthenes for prime numbers
* Karatsuba Multiplication
